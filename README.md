**Original Tutorial Link:** [Stripe Customer Carousel with React + GSAP](https://www.austinoboyle.com/blog/stripe-customer-carousel-with-react-+-gsap/)

**Live Demo:** https://www.austinoboyle.com/stripe-banner-gsap/

This project contains both the starting code and the finished product on how to implement [Stripe's customer banner](https://stripe.com/us/customers) in React using GSAP and react-transition-group to handle the animation logic.

The starting code is on the branch `starting-setup`, the finished code is in `master`.

The starting setup uses the [scss modules template](https://github.com/austinoboyle/cra-scss-modules-bootstrap) I explain in a previous blog article: [SCSS Modules with Create-React-App](https://www.austinoboyle.com/blog/scss-modules-with-create-react-app/).
